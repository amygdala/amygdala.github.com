<h2>Information on the ThinkUp Twitter Realtime (Streaming) Branch</h2>

<p>The links below provide information on setting up and using the Twitter Realtime (User Streams) functionality in 
  <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp/">ThinkUp</a>. The plugin sets up a persistent connection to the Twitter <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/user_streams" title="User Streams | dev.twitter.com">User Streams API</a>, for each active Twitter account (instance) in your ThinkUp installation.</p>

  <p>This functionality is in an <strong>alpha</strong> state and is not yet officially merged into the ThinkUp repository. The 
  <a href="./setup_and_config.html">setup</a> link below provides more detail.<br>
   To run the code in its current state, you need to have access to and be comfortable using the command lineâ€” these scripts can not yet be triggered via the web browser. Eventually, things will become more shrink-wrapped.  This branch is also currently (2011-01-27) missing many tests; more will be added soon.</p>

 <p>It's not yet known whether this code runs as is on Windows (that's what alpha testers are for :) but for sure it will require Cygwin to be installed.
 </p>	
 
 <p>The streaming functionality is implemented via several (indefinitely-)long-running processes.  So, an ISP such as Dreamhost, that kills long-running processes, will not support this plugin very gracefully.  (We may later implement some workarounds for this issue).</p>

	<li>Some <a href="./user_streams_design.html">information on design aspects</a> of the the ThinkUp Twitter Realtime plugin, including the additional data that it is collecting.  We are eager for comments/suggestions on the code and database design.  E.g., now is a great time to consider database schema issues.</li>
